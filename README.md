# googleClone
A google clone I made to better understand the concepts of CSS. I have opted not to use the Google logo and instead wrote 'Search' in Paint and used it as a logo. All icons are from font awesome. The project is just a visual copy. I have avoided inspecting the original webpage for most of the project, however, the color pallete has been directly taken from google.com
